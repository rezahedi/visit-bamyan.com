Afghans take part in a music festival in Bamyan province, central Afghanistan, July 8, 2017. Backed by the Chinese embassy to Afghanistan, UNESCO and the provincial government of Bamyan, the music party "Bamyan Dambora Festival" has been widely welcomed by Afghans, according to Mohammad Ali Shida, one of the organizers of the five-day program. Dambora is a guitar-like music instrument that is poplar and largely used by classic singers and folklore musicians in Afghanistan. (Xinhua/Latif Azimi)


The dambora is the string instrument with the highest symbolic value in the Hazarajat. Bamiyan puts on a special dambora festival every 7-9 July, both in the Provincial Park of Shar-e Now and at Band-e Amir, in which single dambora virtuosi or entire orchestras perform. We have not been able to establish the year of inauguration of this event but it has met with remarkable success, being attended collectively by several thousand listeners.
