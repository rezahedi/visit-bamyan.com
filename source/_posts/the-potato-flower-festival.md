The potato flower festival is a local and agricultural festival each year around may celebrated by local people and farmer organazied by government organization to promote local product!

The Potato Flower Festival (Gol-e Kalachu) on 13 June was organized with great success for the first time in 2017. Several thousand visitors attended the celebrations both in the Provincial Park of the Shahr-e Now and at the entrance of the Foladi Valley. The potato has only very recently advanced (fundamentally only since the fall of the Taliban) to become the by far most important cash crop of the Bamiyan Valley, since it depends on reliable commercial routes. Nowadays, especially in the lower valley, the agricultural landscape is dominated by potato crops, hence the success of the celebrations seems quite understandable.
