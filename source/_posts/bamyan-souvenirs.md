### Traditional Afghan Rugs

Anyone with an unlimited budget might consider buying a traditional Afghan carpet. Hand-made pieces of art that have taken months or in some cases, even years to create sell for a hefty amount. The shop will package and cargo it for you as well but be careful. Unfortunately, an influx of cheap, copycat versions from China flooded the market a few years back and tarnished its reputation because it is very hard to establish the difference between them and a traditional Afghan carpet. Don’t rush your purchase and enlist the help of an expert if you are unsure.
