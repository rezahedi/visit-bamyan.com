### Is Afghanistan Safe to Visit? (The facts.)

Sadly Afghanistan is extremely high on the global terrorism index, we still reeling from decades of conflict, extremist groups and a raging drug war. Afghanistan has incredible sights on offer. The stunningly beautiful Wakhan Corridor, several UNESCO locations and (surprisingly) top ski resorts are some of the attractions travellers will miss, but with terrorist organisations still threatening visitor hot spots with bombings and kidnapping there are some safe places that you can still visit.

However, a lot of Afghanistan isn’t what we’d call safe, while civilian casualties in Afghanistan have reached their highest-recorded level, attacks on tourists are rare.

The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advises against travelling [to most parts of Afghanistan](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/afghanistan), adding that "there is a high threat from terrorism and specific methods of attack are evolving and increasing in sophistication".

The US State Department [goes even further](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/afghanistan-travel-warning.html), warning there is a risk of "kidnapping, hostage taking, military combat operations, landmines, banditry, armed rivalry between political and tribal groups, militant attacks, direct and indirect fire, suicide bombings, and insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne or other improvised explosive devices".

<blockquote>Huge areas of Afghanistan are no-go areas for visitors, but that is not to say everywhere is inaccessible.</blockquote>

"The State Department, the FCO, all advise it is not safe. It is not Sri Lanka or the Maldives, but it's not Libya or Syria either," he said.

"What attracts people to Afghanistan is its diverse landscape - from mountains to deserts to lakes."

If you are visiting Afghanistan, our advice is to carry out plenty of research and avoid roads by flying to your destination.

The BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, who has been travelling to Afghanistan since 1988, said: "There are areas unaffected by the Taliban where you can enjoy Afghans' hospitality, kindness and gentleness, see beautiful sights and stay in decent hotels."

In a word, visiting Bamyan is very safe but have some challenges in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan.

### Safety Tips for Traveling to Afghanistan and Bamyan

Bamyan already well prepared for tourists, so as long as you don’t go to places you shouldn’t. Travel smart and avoid things that seem sketchy and you should be fine. To help you out, here are some tips for staying safe in Afghanistan.

1. Avoid political demonstrations – might seem interesting, but just don’t get involved. Not worth it.
2. Don’t go around flashing your cash – or any amount of fancy jewelry or decedent clothes you might have. Screams “I’m rich and oblivious; scam/rob me!” Keep a money belt on you for ultimate anonymity.
3. Teach yourself a few Afghan words and phrases.
4. DON’T take any drugs – it’s illegal. Prison sentences run as high as 10 years.
5. Careful of what you photograph – it’s against the law to take photos of military installations.
6. Know about mosque etiquette – you don’t want to offend people. Covering your legs and shoulders is mandatory.
7. Dress respectfully – Bamyan may be liberal, but not so much. Watch how other people around you are dressing.
8. Stay hydrated and cover up in the sun – Bamyan can get BAKING hot during the summer months. The sun takes no prisoners!
9. Be respectful during Ramadan – eating in public during the day is not very respectful.
10. Don’t drink alcohol!
