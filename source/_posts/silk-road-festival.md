The most successful festival of cultural entertainment in Afghanistan is without doubt the Silk Road Festival inaugurated in 2009 by the Aga Khan Foundationâ€™s Ecotourism Program and held every September.

This three-day festival offers concerts with traditional and local pop music, folk dances, contests in local games, photo and handicraft exhibitions and the like. It is mostly hosted in the Provincial Park of Shahr-e Now and, for some events, in front of the Buddha cliff. The single events, of course, attract a variable number of spectators, but in sum it can be estimated that up to 10,000 people watch one or the other of the performances.
