This three to five days festival offers concerts with traditional and local pop music, folk dances, contests in local games, photo and handicraft exhibitions and the like.

It is mostly hosted in the Provincial Park of Shahr-e Now and, for some events, in front of the Buddha cliff. The single events, of course, attract a variable number of spectators, but in sum it can be estimated that up to 10,000 people watch one or the other of the performances.

The festival includes many cultural programs, arts camps, the Silk Road festival, a film festival, a local food festival and handicrafts exhibition, will continue for five days.
